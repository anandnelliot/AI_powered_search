## 🚀 Features

### 1. **Semantic Search**
- **Sentence Transformers**: Efficient semantic embeddings for contextual matching.
- **FAISS Vector Store**: Fast similarity search powered by cosine similarity.


### 3. **Visual Search**
- **Image Similarity**: Quickly finds visually similar items using image embeddings and efficient nearest-neighbor retrieval.

### 4. **Hybrid Search**
- Combines Dense (Semantic) and Sparse (Keyword) retrieval methods for comprehensive results.

### 5. **Cross-Encoder Re-ranking**
- Improves search quality by re-ranking initial search results based on query relevance.

### 6. **LLM-Enhanced Recommendations**
- Uses Large Language Models (LLMs) like LLaMA for generating personalized and context-aware recommendations and summaries.

### 7. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
- Integrates retrieval methods with generative models to provide contextually accurate, informative, and coherent responses based on retrieved knowledge.
- Utilizes LangChain and Pinecone for efficient context retrieval and dynamic query handling.

### 8. **User-Friendly Interface**
- Built with **Streamlit**, ensuring a smooth, interactive, and intuitive user experience.

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Text/Visual Query**: User inputs a query or uploads an image.
2. **Search & Retrieve**: AI-powered retrieval engines fetch relevant results.
3. **Re-ranking**: Cross-Encoder re-ranks based on detailed relevance.
4. **Contextual Generation (RAG)**: Context retrieved using dense and sparse methods is fed into LLM to generate comprehensive answers and recommendations.
